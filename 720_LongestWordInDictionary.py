FAQ-


Given an array of strings words representing an English Dictionary, return the longest word in words that can be built
one character at a time by other words in words.

If there is more than one possible answer, return the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order. If there is
no answer, return the empty string.


Example 1:
Input: words = ["w","wo","wor","worl","world"]
Output: "world"
Explanation: The word "world" can be built one character at a time by "w", "wo", "wor", and "worl".

Example 2:
Input: words = ["a","banana","app","appl","ap","apply","apple"]
Output: "apple"
Explanation: Both "apply" and "apple" can be built from other words in the dictionary. However, "apple" is lexicographically smaller than "apply".


Constraints:
1 <= words.length <= 1000
1 <= words[i].length <= 30
words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

    they are longer than current result.

    To find the longest word, all the parents of the child should be true which would mean that its prefix's exists in tree like the problem states.
